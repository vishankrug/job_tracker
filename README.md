- I added a name input for users. It shows their name in the post too, for example: Vishank Rughwani said: Squid Games is insane"

I added og:type to include in the html. It works with the same link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0

For the styling, I added:

margin: auto
width: 30%
I removed the max-width
Moved the index.html body to the center
I did all this so that everything can be centered on the webpage to provide a better design and user experience.
